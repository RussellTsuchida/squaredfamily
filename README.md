Code to accompany the paper: "Squared families: Searching beyond regular probability models"


`model_fit.py` fits a squared family model to some data, as in the paper. It computes 500 maximum likelihood estimates for different dataset samples from the same ground truth target density.

`visualise.py` shows the parameter estimate distributions compared with the asymptotic estimates derived in the paper.
